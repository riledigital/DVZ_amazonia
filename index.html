                The Amazon plays a massive role in the Earth’s ecosystem and is
                a symbol of environmental vulnerability, indigeneity, and
                international cooperation. Though fires in the Amazon are
                seasonal, fire intensity (based on records dating back to 2001)
                have spiked this past summer, correlating with a relatively
                recent increase in deforestation efforts. In August 2019 alone,
                the Amazon is said to have had 80,000 fires—the highest ever
                recorded in a month—making this a highly pertinent issue.

                Mainstream media coverage tends to focus on the environmental
                damage of the Amazon forest fires (eg: loss of wildlife and
                biodiversity, emissions into the atmosphere, local air pollution
                etc.) much more so than the consequential displacement of
                indigenous groups residing in the Amazon.
                <br />
                According to ScienceDaily, approximately 3,000 indigenous
                regions have been identified within the Amazon. With increasing
                plans for economic development and infrastructure, a vast
                majority of indigenous lands alongside protected areas in the
                Brazillian Amazon are at high risk of experiencing disaster.
                Despite this, indigenous groups are currently at the forefront
                of the movement to protect the rainforest against further
                deforestation, illegal logging, and other human invested harmful
                environmental activities.

                Historical Background: How did we get to where we are today?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Although the Amazon had been the site of the rubber tapping
                industry for decades prior, mass deforestation for the
                settlement and development of the Amazon only began after the
                relocation of the Brazilian capital in 1960. Mass migration,
                infrastructural development, and agricultural expansion into the
                forest accelerates for the next several decades, facilitated by
                the construction of the Brasília-Belém and Trans-Amazonian
                Highways as well as government-sponsored settlement programs.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1988, the Brazilian government began to take a stronger
                stance on environmental preservation in its new (and current)
                constitution. In addition to implementing a new framework for
                environmental policy, the new constitution institutes explicit
                measures to preserve indigenous land rights, legalizing the
                process for demarcating indigenous lands.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the 20th century, the problem of deforestation in the
                Amazon lies at the nexus of the conflicting agendas of
                indigenous communities, private land owners (cattle ranchers,
                farmers), the Brazilian government, and international powers.
                The rise of current right-wing Brazilian president Jair
                Bolsonaro threatens to tip the scales heavily in favor of
                accelerated development of the Amazon rainforest, primarily at
                the violent expense of the indigenous people living within.

              On 27 June 2011 the state government published a law authorizing
              an "exchange" with the Fundação Nacional do Índio (Funai) that
              would bring the Xavante people of the Maraiwatsede Indigenous
              Territory (TI) into the park, and regularize ownership by
              squatters in the TI. Funai responded that it had no interest in
              the exchange, which was unconstitutional since indigenous

              The Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is a measure of the rate of radiant
              heat output from a fire. It has been demonstrated in small-scale
              experimental fires that the FRP of a fire is related to the rate
              at which fuel is being consumed (Wooster et al., 2005) and smoke
              emissions released (Freeborn et al., 2008).
