                The Amazon plays a massive role in the Earth’s ecosystem and is
                a symbol of environmental vulnerability, indigeneity, and
                international cooperation. Though fires in the Amazon are seasonal, 
                fire intensity (based on records dating back to 2001) have spiked 
                this past summer, correlating with a relatively recent increase 
                in deforestation efforts. In August 2019 alone, the
                Amazon is said to have had 80,000 fires—the highest ever
                recorded in a month—making this a highly pertinent issue.

              </h2>
              <p>
                Mainstream media coverage tends to focus on the environmental damage of the Amazon forest fires (eg: loss of wildlife and biodiversity, 
                emissions into the atmosphere, local air pollution etc.) much more so than the consequential displacement of indigenous groups residing 
                in the Amazon. According to ScienceDaily, approximately 3,000 indigenous regions have been identified within the Amazon. With increasing
                plans for economic development and infrastructure, a vast majority of indigenous lands alongside protected areas in the Brazillian Amazon
                are at high risk of experiencing disaster. Despite this, indigenous groups are currently at the forefront of the movement to protect the 
                rainforest against further deforestation, illegal logging, and other human invested harmful environmental activities.

              <p>
                Deforestation via the agricultural, infrastructural etc. development of the Amazon roughly begins to accelerate in the 1960s 
                beginning with Brazil's military regime, which ends in the mid 1980s. Histories of settler colonialism, indigenous genocide, 
                enslavement (eg: rubber tapping industries, haciendas, etc.), and displacement begin long before actual development and clearing of 
                Amazon land and thus, although not the primary focal point of this data story, remain a part of the essential background context for 
                effect on indigenous rights by Brazilian policy. ***[IN PROGRESS]***

Parque Estadual do Araguaia (English: The Araguaia State Park) is a highly biodiverse state park located in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. 
              It protects an area of the annually flooded, tropical savanna ecoregion known as the <i>Cerrado</i>.

            <p>
              On 27 June 2011 the state government published a law authorizing an "exchange" with the Fundação Nacional do Índio (Funai) that would bring the Xavante people of the Maraiwatsede Indigenous Territory (TI) into the park, and regularize ownership by squatters in the TI. Funai responded that it had no interest in the exchange, which was unconstitutional since indigenous territory is inalienable.[9][a]

            What is Fire Radiative Power?
          </h2>
            <blockquote>
The Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is a measure of the rate of radiant heat output from a fire. 
It has been demonstrated in small-scale experimental fires that the FRP of a fire is related 
to the rate at which fuel is being consumed (Wooster et al., 2005) and smoke emissions released 
(Freeborn et al., 2008). (http://cedadocs.ceda.ac.uk/770/1/SEVIRI_FRP_documentdesc.pdf)
