                The Amazon plays a massive role in the Earth’s ecosystem and is
                a symbol of environmental vulnerability, indigeneity, and
                international cooperation. Though fires in the Amazon are
                seasonal, fire intensity (based on records dating back to 2003)
                spiked this past summer, correlating with a relatively recent
                increase in deforestation efforts. In August 2019 alone, the
                Amazon is said to have had 80,000 fires – the highest ever
                recorded in a month — making this issue highly prevalent.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mainstream media coverage tends to focus on the environmental damage of the Amazon forest fires (eg: loss of wildlife/biodiversity, emissions into the atmosphere, local air pollution etc.) much more so than the consequential displacement of indigenous groups residing in the Amazon. Despite this, indigenous groups are currently at the forefront of the movement to protect the rainforest against further deforestation.

            What is Fire Radiative Power?
          </h2>
            <blockquote>
> The Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is a measure of the rate of radiant heat output from a fire. It has been demonstrated in small-scale experimental fires that the FRP of a fire is related to the rate at which fuel is being consumed (Wooster et al., 2005) and smoke emissions released (Freeborn et al., 2008).
