                The Amazon plays a massive role in the Earth’s ecosystem and is
                also an iconic symbol of environmental vulnerability,
                indigeneity, and international cooperation. Fires in the Amazon
                are seasonal, but fire intensity since 2001 have spiked this
                past summer, correlating with a relatively recent increase in
                deforestation efforts. In August 2019 alone, the Amazon is said
                to have had 80,000 fires—the highest ever recorded in a month.

                Mainstream media coverage tends to focus on the environmental
                damage of the Amazon forest fires (eg: loss of wildlife and
                biodiversity, emissions into the atmosphere, local air pollution
                etc.) much more so than the consequential displacement of
                indigenous groups residing in the Amazon.
              </p>

              <p>
                Approximately 6,345 indigenous territories or regions have been
                identified within the Amazon. [2] According to ScienceDaily,
                with increasing plans for economic development and
                infrastructure, a vast majority of indigenous lands alongside
                protected areas in the Brazillian Amazon are at high risk of
                experiencing disaster. [3] Despite this, indigenous groups are
                currently at the forefront of the movement to protect the
                rainforest against further deforestation, illegal logging, and
                other human invested harmful environmental activities.

                Our research focus
              </h2>

              <p class="lead">
                To what extent are indigenous lands affected by
                deforestation-related fires?
              </p>

              <p>
                Indigenous land stewardship is proven to be vital to the
                preservation of the Amazon rainforest: demarcated indigenous
                lands are protected both by the law and by residing tribes
                against incursions by loggers and cattle ranchers. As such,
                statistics show that rates of deforestation drop significantly
                within indigenous borders. [4]
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the protections nominally offered by the Brazilian
                government are precarious at best. The demarcation process that
                protects ancestral lands is often slow to complete or altogether
                paralyzed, subject to shifting political agendas and
                bureaucratic fine print. Moreover, protections to already
                demarcated lands are often unenforced by local government
                agencies, frequently leaving vulnerable indigenous communities
                to fend for themselves against illegal invasions and land
                disputes. [5]

                Since the start of his term in January, President Bolsonaro has
                made attempts to defang the two government agencies responsible
                for the protection of the Amazon and its indigenous residents,
                IBAMA and FUNAI. Additionally, Bolsonaro's pro-agribusiness
                campaign has emboldened both private land owners and illegal
                land grabbers (<em>grileiros</em>) residing in the Amazon to
                claim and deforest land, especially that which lies at or past
                the borders of indigenous lands. [6]

                On 27 June 2011 the state government published a law authorizing
                an "exchange" with the Fundação Nacional do Índio (Funai) that
                would bring the Xavante people of the Maraiwatsede Indigenous
                Territory (TI) into the park, and regularize ownership by
                squatters in the TI. Funai responded that it had no interest in
                the exchange, which was unconstitutional since indigenous
                territory is inalienable. [7]

                Brazil's environmental policies affect the future of the Amazon
              </h2>

              <p class="lead">
                The Amazon's ecosystem still suffers from environmental policy
                dating back to the sixties.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the Amazon had been the site of the rubber tapping
                industry for decades prior, mass deforestation for the
                settlement and development of the Amazon only began after the
                relocation of the Brazilian capital in 1960. Mass migration,
                infrastructural development, and agricultural expansion into the
                forest accelerates for the next several decades, facilitated by
                the construction of the Brasília-Belém and Trans-Amazonian
                Highways as well as government-sponsored settlement programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1988, the Brazilian government began to take a stronger
                stance on environmental preservation in its new (and current)
                constitution. In addition to implementing a new framework for
                environmental policy, the new constitution institutes explicit
                measures to preserve indigenous land rights, legalizing the
                process for demarcating indigenous lands. [10]
              </p>
              <p>
                In the 20th century, the problem of deforestation in the Amazon
                lies at the nexus of the conflicting agendas of indigenous
                communities, private land owners (cattle ranchers, farmers), the
                Brazilian government, and international powers. The rise of
                current right-wing Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro threatens
                to tip the scales heavily in favor of accelerated development of
                the Amazon rainforest, primarily at the violent expense of the
                indigenous people living within.

                  The Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is a measure of the rate of
                  radiant heat output from a fire. It has been demonstrated in
                  small-scale experimental fires that the FRP of a fire is
                  related to the rate at which fuel is being consumed (Wooster
                  et al., 2005) and smoke emissions released (Freeborn et al.,
