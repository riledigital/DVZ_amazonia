        <h2 class="intro__h2">Fires in the Amazon</h2>
        <p class="intro__p">
          The Amazon plays a massive role in the Earth’s ecosystem and is also
          an iconic symbol of environmental vulnerability, indigeneity, and
          international cooperation.
        </p>
        <p class="intro__p">
          Fires in the Amazon are seasonal, but fire intensity since 2001 has
          spiked this past summer, correlating with a relatively recent increase
          in deforestation efforts. In August 2019 alone, the Amazon is said to
          have had 80,000 fires—the highest ever recorded in a month. [1]
        </p>
        <p class="intro__p">
          We identified fires in indigenous territories recognized by Fundación
          Nacional del Indio (FUNAI) using data on all fire events detected
          through MODIS from 2000 to 2019 from NASA's FIRMS project.

        <h2 class="intro__h2">The Amazon is home to indigenous communities</h2>
        <p class="intro__p">
          Mainstream media coverage tends to focus on the environmental damage
          of the Amazon forest fires (eg: loss of wildlife and biodiversity,
          emissions into the atmosphere, local air pollution etc.) much more so
          than the consequential displacement of indigenous groups residing in
          the Amazon.
        </p>

        <p class="intro__p">
          Approximately 6,345 indigenous territories or regions have been
          identified within the Amazon. [2] According to ScienceDaily, with
          increasing plans for economic development and infrastructure, a vast
          majority of indigenous lands alongside protected areas in the
          Brazillian Amazon are at high risk of experiencing disaster. [3]
          Despite this, indigenous groups are currently at the forefront of the
          movement to protect the rainforest against further deforestation,
          illegal logging, and other human invested harmful environmental
          activities.
        </p>

        <h2 class="intro__h2">Our research focus</h2>

        <p class="intro__p">
          To what extent are indigenous lands affected by deforestation-related
          fires?
        </p>

        <p class="intro__p">
          Indigenous land stewardship is proven to be vital to the preservation
          of the Amazon rainforest: demarcated indigenous lands are protected
          both by the law and by residing tribes against incursions by loggers
          and cattle ranchers. As such, statistics show that rates of
          deforestation drop significantly within indigenous borders. [4]
        </p>
        <p class="intro__p">
          However, the protections nominally offered by the Brazilian government
          are precarious at best. The demarcation process that protects
          ancestral lands is often slow to complete or altogether paralyzed,
          subject to shifting political agendas and bureaucratic fine print.
          Moreover, protections to already demarcated lands are often unenforced
          by local government agencies, frequently leaving vulnerable indigenous
          communities to fend for themselves against illegal invasions and land
          disputes. [5]
        </p>

        <p class="intro__p">
          Since the start of his term in January, President Bolsonaro has made
          attempts to defang the two government agencies responsible for the
          protection of the Amazon and its indigenous residents, IBAMA and
          FUNAI. Additionally, Bolsonaro's pro-agribusiness campaign has
          emboldened both private land owners and illegal land grabbers
          (<em>grileiros</em>) residing in the Amazon to claim and deforest
          land, especially that which lies at or past the borders of indigenous
          lands. [6]

        <h3 class="intro_plot-title">Focus Regions Fire Count (2001–2019)</h3>
        <div id="top10_areagraph"></div>

        <p class="intro__p">
          We narrowed down the thousands of indigenous territories located
          within the countries of the Brazillian Amazon to ten specific regions.
          These regions demonstrate the highest cumulative fire counts over the
          past two decades from 2000 to September 2019.

        </div>

        <p class="intro__p">
          We further condensed the data down to three focus regions — these
          three territories presented relatively greater fire count in
          comparison to other indigenous lands. We wanted to investigate the
          historical and political context of these lands to identify potential
          causative factors. Size of the land did not appear to be a relatively
          indicative factor.

          <p>
            Parque Estadual do Araguaia (English: The Araguaia State Park) is a
            highly biodiverse state park located in the state of Mato Grosso,
            Brazil. It protects an area of the annually flooded, tropical
            savanna ecoregion known as the <em>Cerrado</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 27 June 2011 the state government published a law authorizing an
            "exchange" with the Fundação Nacional do Índio (Funai) that would
            bring the Xavante people of the Maraiwatsede Indigenous Territory
            (TI) into the park, and regularize ownership by squatters in the TI.
            Funai responded that it had no interest in the exchange, which was
            unconstitutional since indigenous territory is inalienable. [7]

            Marãiwatséde is a traditional territory located in the state of Mato
            Grosso, Brazil. It was recognized as land belonging to the Xavante
            people of the southern Amazon in 1998, but continued to be illegally
            invaded by external parties. The name of the region means "high
            forest" or "dangerous forest" in the native language of the Xavante.
            [8] Xavante title to the Marãiwatséde territory was recognized in an
            act signed by the Brazilian president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, in
            1998. However, less than 10 percent of the territory is occupied by
            the Indian tribe and 85 percent of the land has been deforested or
            degraded[8]

        <h2>Brazil's environmental policies affect the future of the Amazon</h2>

        <p class="lead">
          The Amazon's ecosystem still suffers from environmental policy dating
          back to the sixties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the Amazon had been the site of the rubber tapping industry
          for decades prior, mass deforestation for the settlement and
          development of the Amazon only began after the relocation of the
          Brazilian capital in 1960. Mass migration, infrastructural
          development, and agricultural expansion into the forest accelerates
          for the next several decades, facilitated by the construction of the
          Brasília-Belém and Trans-Amazonian Highways as well as
          government-sponsored settlement programs. [10]
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1988, the Brazilian government began to take a stronger stance on
          environmental preservation in its new (and current) constitution. In
          addition to implementing a new framework for environmental policy, the
          new constitution institutes explicit measures to preserve indigenous
          land rights, legalizing the process for demarcating indigenous lands.
          [11]
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 20th century, the problem of deforestation in the Amazon lies
          at the nexus of the conflicting agendas of indigenous communities,
          private land owners (cattle ranchers, farmers), the Brazilian
          government, and international powers. The rise of current right-wing
          Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro threatens to tip the scales heavily
          in favor of accelerated development of the Amazon rainforest,
          primarily at the violent expense of the indigenous people living
          within.

        <p>
          Point data on fires was gathered from the NASA FIRMS project, we used
          data from MODIS M6, selected from 2000-2010 within the national
          boundaries of Brazil. Geography for indigenous lands of Brazil is from
          <a
            href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/brazil-indigenous-lands"
          >
            Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI)</a

          and indexed by the
          <a href="https://globalforestwatch.org">Global Forest Watch</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>
          We joined data from NASA FIRMS (MODIS M6) with the FUNAI recognized
          indigenous land data from Global Forest Watch using QGIS. All data was
          converted to Geopackage and transformed to EPSG:4674 before executing
          a spaital join operation. We used Tidyverse R to group, summarize, and
          export summary tables for areas, using Tableau to conduct EDA. Our
          visualizations were designed with Vega-Lite.
